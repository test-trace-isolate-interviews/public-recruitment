The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has sadly resulted in the illness and deaths of many people in the UK and abroad. Damages to health and wellbeing have occurred both directly from the disease and indirectly via its disruptive effects on society and the economy. In the midst of this pandemic emergency, policy-makers in the UK require rapid evidence to inform decision-making. While ‘lockdown’ interventions and restrictive social distancing policies have been used to reduce infections in the population, these approaches are relatively untargeted and carry high costs. Our research, which primarily uses mathematical modelling, aims to assess how COVID-19 testing, contact tracing and isolation can best be designed in order to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and its associated harms. Essentially, we develop and run models and simulations of the process of infection in the population and the processes of different testing policies and technologies, contact tracing and isolation strategies. This evidence gives us insight into what approaches might be most effective and can be considered alongside behavioural and social research and studies conducted ‘in the real world’. Our academic research project, *An analytical framework for Test, Trace and Isolate (TTI) in the UK*, has been providing advice to policy-makers and public health via government scientific advisory channels, primarily the SPI-M sub-committee of SAGE. 

We recognise that in order to develop useful modelling tools for informing decisions about TTI, we need to understand the experiences and views of members of the public who have heard about and been asked to engage in various aspects of testing, contact tracing and isolating for COVID-19. It is also important that we understand the perspectives of people working in different ways to deliver these TTI interventions and to ensure that our mathematical modelling reflects their priorities and experiences of the way these policies have worked in practice. 

In the present study, we are interviewing members of the public and stakeholders about the assumptions and processes that we include in the models that we use to understand the potential effectiveness of different TTI strategies.
